As promised *HERE I NEED A LINK TO THE PT 1. ARTICLE*

RESEDA is a machine standing in the neutron guide hall of the Forschungs-Neutronenquelle Heinz Maier-Leibnitz.
With RESEDA we want to study how atoms and other tiny particles inside matter move. 
For this, RESEDA uses neutrons.
Neutrons are the neutral particles that make up the core of an atom together with the positively charged protons. Since they are electrically neutral they are not influenced by the electrons that surround the atom cores and can therefore reach much deeper into matter than other particles (such as X-rays for examples).
However, neutrons do have a magnetic spin. 
This means that they are similar to very tiny magnets, and can therefore be influenced by magnetic materials and magnetic fields (like moving iron shavings with a magnet, just much much smaller). When a neutron is put in a magnetic field that does NOT point along the direction of its own spin, it starts to precess like a spinning top. 

The neutrons that come from our reactor source are led to RESEDA using special neutron guides. The neutrons arrive at RESEDA with different speeds. For our experiments, we only select neutrons within a certain speed range. A lot of the time we choose neutrons that are in a velocity range of about 2080 to 2675 kilometers per hour. (That seems pretty fast, but for neutrons from a nuclear reactor this is actually pretty slow.)
One of the strengths of RESEDA, and machines similar to it, is that it can use neutrons within a broad velocity range and still measure very accurately. This means RESEDA can use many more neutrons than some other machines. Because for some instruments the exact speed of the neutrons is very important. Since the reactor produces neutrons with many different speeds, this means that they can only use very few neutrons, so the more accurately they want to measure, the longer they need to measure. 
(maybe calculate approximately how many more neutrons that gives… monochromator vs selector)

After the neutrons have been selected by their speed they arrive at the polarizer, where the neutron beam is polarized. Before the polarizer the magnetic spin of the neutrons in the beam can point in all different directions. For experiments where the structure of a material is studied this is perfectly fine. However, if we want to study magnetic properties of a material, we need a polarized neutron beam, a neutron beam where all spins point in the same direction. At RESEDA we polarize neutrons with a V-shaped supermirror. A supermirror consists of many, many very thin layers of iron and silicon and only lets one direction of neutrons pass through, while reflecting the others. At RESEDA we polarize the neutrons such that their spin points upwards, in a right angle to their flight direction.

After polarizing the neutrons we carefully flip their spin into their flight direction, using a small magnetic field coil. Once the neutron spin points along the flight direction we use these coils as guide fields, so the neutrons don’t lose their polarization. This can be done by applying a small magnetic field that points in the same direction as the spin. At RESEDA we use coils made from copper wire wound around the metal frame of bicycle wheels as guide fields. When a current runs through a wire wound in a loop like that, it will produce a magnetic field pointing along the axle of the bicycle wheel. 

Before reaching the heart of the setup, the resonant spin flippers, the neutron spin is again moved upright. With this, we want to define a point where the angle the neutron spin has rotated is zero. As you can see we do like to play around with the neutron spin a lot at RESEDA. 

At the first resonant spin flipper, the neutron spin gets flipped by a specific angle that depends on the frequency with which the resonant spin flipper is operated. The neutron is then allowed to fly for a bit more than one meter before it reaches the second resonant spin flipper, which operates at a higher frequency than the first flipper. There, the spin gets flipped in the opposite direction. The total angle by which the spin was flipped at this point during its flight path depends on the difference between the two frequencies of the flippers. 

The analyzer that is placed just after the second resonant spin flipper uses the angle of the neutrons and translates it into a periodically oscillating signal. The frequency of this oscillation is twice the difference between the two frequencies of the flippers. 

After the analyzer the neutrons finally reach the sample we want to study. We can cool the materials we want to study or heat them up, and we can apply magnetic fields and even pressure to the sample, to study materials under all sorts of different conditions. 
When a neutron hits our sample several things can happen:
1) it flies through the sample as if nothing happened (this gives us a static background)
2) it gets absorbed by the sample 
3) it gets reflected off the sample
4) it interacts with the sample, by for example hitting an atom (this we call nuclear scattering) or being influenced by a magnetic field inside the sample (which we call magnetic scattering)

It’s the last of those processes that we want to study. 

When a neutron hits an atom or gets influenced by a magnetic field it either loses some energy and therefore slows down, or it gains some energy and speeds up. So the neutrons that actually hit the sample are either slower or faster than the ones that just flew through.

After the neutrons hit the sample they fly through a vacuum tube (so they don’t hit any air and scatter off that) to our detector. 

A detector is in principle just a very specific camera. Instead of capturing light as with a classic camera, we capture neutrons. At RESEDA we study the motion of atoms or magnetic fields inside materials, so in addition to taking an image of where the neutrons hit our detector we need some information on the time at which the neutron hits the detector. 
This is where we come back to all the spin flipping we did before the sample. 
Choosing different frequencies of our resonant spin flippers gives us different intensity modulations of the neutron beam. An intensity modulation means nothing else that our neutron beam now goes from bright to dark to bright again and so forth. The time it takes to go from bright to dark and to bright again is the time we used that time as a timer for our camera. 
For example if we want to know if anything in our material moves on the timescale of 0.000000001 seconds, we set the frequencies of our spin flippers and camera timer accordingly and then take many, many pictures and evaluate them. If something moves on the timescale of 0.000000001 seconds (for example a water molecule moving in a glass of water happens at around that time scale) then more of the neutrons will scatter. And so less neutrons will arrive at the exact same time the picture is taken. So the contrast of our picture gets worse. 
If we repeat this measurement for different times, we can figure out at which time scale atoms/molecules/magnetic fields move inside a material. We can for example study how fast water molecules move in water or how fast something dissolved in water moves (which can be very important to study new medicines etc). We can also study how fast magnetic processes happen and can investigate new materials for better and faster hard drives.

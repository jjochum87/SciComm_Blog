*Scientists found that the heating process with magnetic nanoparticles  is much more complex than was initially thought.*

Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are tiny little particles (several nanometers in size) that consist of a magnetic material and can be influenced by magnetic fields. In a magnetic field the particles do *not* behave as if they consisted of many different atoms, but like one big magnetic system with a *macrospin*. Very often they are coated with a non-magnetic material that can be functionalized for different applications. 

Researchers have been investigating MNPs with the hope to someday apply them for many useful purposes. Among the most promising ones is magnetic fluid hyperthermia,  a technique that uses high frequency magnetic fields to induce motion/relaxation of the macrospin of the particles to produce heat. When injected into tissue, such as cancerous tumours, MNPs can be used to heat the tissue very locally and destroy cancer cells.

 However, for such application the heating properties of the particles need to be well understood and optimized. 
Until very recently, it was believed that the heating properties of MNPs depend simply on the particle size and their basic magnetic properties, such the temperature at which the material becomes magnetic, the strength of the magnetism and homogeneity of the magnetism (is it stronger in one direction than in another one?).
But the team of Prof. Vejpravová found that this only holds true for the initial heating phase.  After that,  the effect of temperature on the magnetic properties of MNPs becomes more complex and is not fully understood yet. 

A possible reason for this, according to the researchers, could be the competition between the two different heating processes that occur inside the particles. Heat is released through the motion of the entire particle (Brownian mechanism) and through the motion of the macrospin alone (Néel mechanism). These two mechanisms are occurring at the same time and fight for dominance. Which of them “wins” depends on the magnetic properties, size and coating of the MNPs as well as the temperature and magnetic field strength.

*Scientists found that the heating process with magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) is much more complex than was initially thought.*

Researchers have been investigating MNPs with the hope to someday apply them for many useful purposes. Among the most promising ones is magnetic fluid hyperthermia,  a technique that uses high frequency magnetic fields to induce motion/relaxation of the macrospin of the particles to produce heat. When injected into tissue, such as cancerous tumours, MNPs can be used to heat the tissue very locally and destroy cancer cells.

 However, for such application the heating properties of the particles need to be well understood and optimized. 
Until very recently, it was believed that the heating properties of MNPs depend simply on the particle size and their basic magnetic properties, such the temperature at which the material becomes magnetic, the strength of the magnetism and homogeneity of the magnetism (is it stronger in one direction than in another one?).

But the researchers found that this only holds true for the initial heating phase.  After that,  the effect of temperature on the magnetic properties of MNPs becomes more complex. 
A possible reason for this, according to the researchers, could be the competition between the two different heating processes that occur inside the particles. 
The team made this surprising discovery while studying the size and coating dependence of CoFe2O4 MNPs with high-resolution TEM, SQUID magnetometry and differential thermal analysis.
